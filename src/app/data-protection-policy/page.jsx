            The Organisation needs to collect and use certain types of information about staff, clients and other individuals who come into
            contact with the company in order to operate. In addition, it may be required by law to collect and use certain types of
            information to comply with statutory obligations of Local Authorities, government agencies and other bodies.
            <br /> <br />
            This personal information must be dealt with properly, however it is collected, recorded and used — whether on paper, in a
            computer, or recorded on other material — and there are safeguards to ensure this is within the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018.
            <br /> <br />
            We regard the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as very important to successful operations, and to
            maintaining confidence between those with whom we deal and ourselves. We ensure that our Organisation treats personal
            information lawfully and correctly.
            <br /> <br />
            Most businesses hold personal data on their customers, employees and partners. The explosion in the use of the Internet,
            electronic communication and computerisation of business data has led to an increase in the importance of privacy. Breaches of
            computerised data security have prompted the introduction of legislation on a national and European level.

            individual Member States that were developed in compliance with the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Its purpose is to
            protect the “rights and freedoms” of living individuals, and to ensure that personal data is not processed without their
            knowledge, and, wherever possible, that it is processed with their consent.

            The top management of Global Mediation Limited are strongly committed to the rights of individuals whose data they collect and
            process and will comply with UK and EU laws related to personal information in line with the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR).
            <br /> <br />
            The top management of Global Mediation Limited ensures that it meet its requirements under EU GDPR for the management of
            personal information, that the objectives of Global Mediation Limited and obligations under the law are met, and ensures that
            controls are in place that reflect the level of risk that Global Mediation Limited is willing to accept. In addition, steps are
            taken to ensure that Global Mediation Limited is able to meet all the regulatory, statutory and contractual obligations that are
            applicable, including the protection of the interests of individuals and all other relevant stakeholders.

                Global Mediation Limited has notified the Information Commissioner that it is a data controller and/or processor and that it
                processes personal data. Global Mediation Limited has identified and recorded all the personal data that it processes in the
                Data Register.

              </li>
              <li>
                The DPO is responsible for reviewing the details of notification to ensure that any changes to the way that Global Mediation
                Limited processes or controls personal data is (as determined by changes to the Data Register and following management
                review) referred back to the Additional requirements for notification may also arise from Personal Data Impact Assessments.

                The policy applies to all Employees and Processors of Global Mediation Limited such as outsourced suppliers. Any breach of
                the GDPR will be considered as a breach of the disciplinary policy and could also be considered a criminal offence,
                potentially resulting in prosecution.

            All third parties working with or for Global Mediation Limited, and who have or may have access to personal information, will be
            expected to comply with this policy. All third parties who require access to personal data will be required to sign a
            confidentiality agreement before access is permitted. This agreement will ensure that the third party has the same legal
            obligations as Global Mediation Limited. This will also include an agreement that Global Mediation Limited can audit compliance
            with the agreement.
            <br /> <br />
            GDPR will apply to all controllers that are established in the EU (European Union) who process the personal data of data
            subjects, in the context of that establishment. It will also apply to controllers outside of the EU that process personal data
            in order to offer goods and services, or monitor the behaviour of data subjects who are resident in the EU.
            <br /> <br />
            The location, for the purposes of GDPR, of any data controller located in the EU will be the place where the controller makes
            the key decisions related to the data processing purpose. This is likely to be Global Mediation Limited HQ.
            <br /> <br />
            Any data controller that is not located within the EU will be required to appoint a representative in a location that is under
            the jurisdiction that applies to the data that is being used in order to act on behalf of the controller and engage with the
            appropriate supervisory authorities for that location.

            Senior Management and all those in managerial or supervisory roles throughout Global Mediation Limited are responsible for
            developing and encouraging good information handling practices within the organisation; responsibilities are set out in
            individual job descriptions.
            <br /> <br />
            A Data Protection Officer, a member of the senior management team, is accountable to the top management of Global Mediation
            Limited for the management of personal information within Global Mediation Limited and for ensuring that compliance with data
            protection legislation and good practice can be demonstrated. This accountability includes the development and implementation of
            security and risk management to ensure compliance.
            <br /> <br />
            Global Mediation Limited has appointed a suitably qualified and experienced Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is responsible for
            day-to-day compliance with this policy. The DPO is responsible for ensuring that Global Mediation Limited complies with the GDPR
            in relation to all aspects of data processing. The DPO has direct responsibility for policy and procedures, including Subject
            Access Requests. The DPO is also the person to whom all staff will go to seek guidance regarding GDPR compliance.
            <br /> <br />
            It should be noted that compliance with GDPR requirements remains the responsibility of all staff who process or control
            personal information for Global Mediation Limited. All members of staff employed by Global Mediation Limited are also
            responsible for ensuring that any personal data that is about them that is supplied by them to Global Mediation Limited is
            accurate and up to date.

          <p className="mt-6">
            Global Mediation Limited needs to ensure that it is aware of any risks associated with the processing of all types of personal
            information. A Risk Assessment procedure has been implemented and is used by Global Mediation Limited to assess any risk to
            individuals during processing of their personal information. Assessments will also be completed by Global Mediation Limited for
            any processing that is undertaken on their behalf by any third party organisation. Global Mediation Limited will also, through
            the application of the Risk Assessment procedure, ensure that any identified risks are managed appropriately to reduce the risk
            of non-compliance.
            <br /> <br />
            Where processing of personal information may result in a high risk to the “rights and freedoms” of natural persons, Global
            Mediation Limited shall complete a data protection impact assessment, prior to conducting the processing, to ensure the personal
            information is protected. This assessment may also be used to apply to a number of similar processing scenarios with a similar
            level of risk.
            <br /> <br />
            Where, as a result of a Data Protection Impact Assessment, it is clear that Global Mediation Limited will process personal
            information in a manner that may cause damage and/or distress to the data subjects, the DPO must review the process before
            Global Mediation Limited proceeds to process the information. If the DPO decides that there are significant risks to the data
            subject they will escalate to the ICO for final guidance.
            <br /> <br />
            The Organisation shall apply selected controls for the ISO 27001 Annex A to reduce risk. This should also reference Global
            Mediation Limited’s risk acceptance criteria and the requirements of the GDPR.

          <p className="mt-6">
            Any processing of personal data must be conducted in accordance with the following data protection principles of the Regulation,
            and Global Mediation Limited’s policies and procedures will ensure compliance.
            <br /> <br />
            Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. Global Mediation Limited’s Fair Processing Procedure details
            how this is achieved.
            <br /> <br />
            The GDPR introduces the requirement for transparency whereby the controller has transparent and easily accessible policies
            relating to the processing of personal data and the exercise of individuals’ ‘rights and freedoms’.
            <br /> <br />
            Information must be communicated to the data subject in an intelligible form using clear and plain language.

              <li>The period for which the personal data will be stored</li>
              <li>The existence of the rights to request access, rectification, erasure or to object to the processing</li>
              <li>The categories of personal data concerned</li>

            not be used for a purpose that differs from those formally notified to the Information Commissioner as part of Global Mediation
            Limited’s GDPR registration.
            <br /> <br />
            Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for processing. The Data Protection Officer is
            responsible for ensuring that information, which is not strictly necessary for the purpose for which it is obtained, is not
            collected.
            <br /> <br />
            All data collection methods (electronic or paper-based), including data collection requirements in new information systems, must
            be approved by the Data Protection Officer and approval recorded.
            <br /> <br />
            The Data Protection Officer will ensure that all data collection methods are reviewed annually by internal audit or external
            experts to ensure that collection continues to be adequate, relevant and not excessive.
            <br /> <br />
            The DPO is responsible for ensuring that any data that is shown to have been obtained excessively, or is not specifically
            required by Global Mediation Limited, is securely deleted or destroyed (see A.8.3.2 and A.11.2.7).

          <span>Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.</span>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Data that is kept for a long time must be reviewed and updated as necessary. Any data that is considered to be inaccurate or
            likely to be inaccurate must be removed.
            <br /> <br />
            Top management is responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained in the importance of collecting accurate data and
            maintaining it.
            <br /> <br />
            All individuals are responsible for ensuring that any data held by Global Mediation Limited is accurate and up to date. Any data
            submitted by an individual to a company, such as via a registration form, will be considered to be accurate at the time of
            receipt.
            <br /> <br />
            Employees or other individuals should notify Global Mediation Limited of any changes in personal information to ensure personal
            information is kept up to date. It is the responsibility of Global Mediation Limited to ensure that any notification of changes
            to personal information is implemented.
            <br /> <br />
            The DPO is responsible for ensuring that all necessary actions are taken to ensure personal information is accurate and up to
            date. This should also take into account the volume of data collected, the speed with which it might change and any other
            relevant factors.
            <br /> <br />
            The DPO will review, at least once a year, all the personal data processed by Global Mediation Limited, held in the Data
            Register. The DPO will note any data that is no longer required in the context of the registered purpose and will ensure that it
            is appropriately removed and securely disposed of (see A.8.3.2 and A.11.2.7).
            <br /> <br />
            If a third party organisation has provided inaccurate or out-of-date personal information, the DPO is responsible for informing
            them that the personal information is inaccurate and/ or out-of-date and will advise them that the information should no longer
            be used. The DPO should also ensure that any correction to the personal information is passed on to the third party.

          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2 text-4xl text-secondary">Personal data considerations</h3>
          <span>
            Personal data must be kept in a form such that the data subject can be identified only as long as is necessary for processing.
          </span>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Where personal data is retained beyond the processing date, it will be encrypted in order to protect the identity of the data
            subject in the event of a data breach.
            <br /> <br />
            Personal data will be retained in line with the retention of records procedure and, once its retention date is passed, it must
            be securely destroyed as set out in the Retention of Records Procedure.
            <br /> <br />
            The DPO must specifically approve any data retention that exceeds the retention periods defined in the Retention of Records
            procedure and must ensure that the justification is clearly identified and in line with the requirements of the data protection
            legislation.
            <br /> <br />
            This approval must be written.
            <br /> <br />
            Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures its security.
            <br /> <br />
            Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data
            and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. These controls have been selected on the basis of
            identified risks to personal data, and the potential for damage or distress to individuals whose data is being processed.
            Security controls will be subject to audit and review.
            <br /> <br />
            Global Mediation Limited’s compliance with this principle is contained in its Information Security Management System (ISMS),
            which has been developed in line with ISO/IEC 27001 : 2013 and the Security Policy set out in the ISMS.
            <br /> <br />
            Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Union Member States unless that country or
            territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the ‘rights and freedoms’ of data subjects in relation to the processing
            of personal data.
            <br /> <br />
            The transfer of personal data outside of the EU Member States is prohibited unless one or more of the specified safeguards or
            exceptions apply.

            of all processing operations, and implement appropriate security measures. They are also responsible for completing Data
            Processing Impact Assessments (DPIAs), complying with requirements for prior notifications, or approval from supervisory

            using a complaint form supplied by Global Mediation Limited. [A complaints form and procedure must be implemented to include a
            GDPR complaints section. This would normally be provided through the ‘Contact Us’ section of the company website. It is also
            important to display a Fair Processing Notice at this point.] <br /> <br />A Data Subject also has the option to complain
            directly to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Details of the options for lodging a complaint should be provided by Global

          <span>
            Global Mediation Limited understands ‘consent’ to mean that it has been explicitly and freely given, specific, informed and
            unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she by statement, or by a clear affirmative action, signifies
            agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. The consent of the data subject can be withdrawn at any
            time.
            <br /> <br />
            In addition, Global Mediation Limited understands ‘consent’ to mean that the data subject has been fully informed of the
            intended processing and has signified their agreement, while in a fit state of mind to do so and without pressure being exerted
            upon them. Consent obtained under duress or on the basis of misleading information will not be a valid basis for processing.
            There must be some active communication between the parties which demonstrate active consent. Consent cannot be inferred from
            non- response to a communication. For sensitive data, explicit written consent of data subjects must be obtained unless an
            alternative legitimate basis for processing exists.
            <br /> <br />
            Consent to process personal and sensitive data is obtained routinely by Global Mediation Limited using standard consent
            documents. This may be through a contract of employment or during induction.
            <br /> <br />
            Where Global Mediation Limited provides online services to children, parental, or custodial authorisation must be obtained. This

            specifically authorised by Global Mediation Limited to receive that information and has entered into a confidentiality
            agreement.
            <br /> <br />
            All personal data should be accessible only to those who need to use it, and access may only be granted in line with the Access
            Control Policy. You should form a judgment based upon the sensitivity and value of the information in question, but personal

            <br /> <br />
            Personal data may only be deleted or disposed of in line with the Retention of Records procedure. Manual records that have
            reached their retention date are to be shredded and disposed of as ‘confidential waste’. Hard drives of redundant PCs are to be
            removed and immediately destroyed (see A.8.3.2 and A.11.2.7).Because of the increased risk, all Staff must be specifically

            In addition, the Organisation’s employees will be kept fully informed about overall information security procedures and the
            importance of their role within these procedures. Similarly, manual filing systems are held in secure locations and only
            authorised employees can access them.

            The Managing Director has overall responsibility for the administration and implementation of the Organisation’s Data Protection
            Policy. <br /> <br />
            Each Department Manager will assume authority for the compliance of the employees within their department.
            <br /> <br />
            This Policy will be updated as necessary to reflect best practice in data management, security and control and to ensure
            compliance with any changes or amendments made to the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR.
            <br /> <br />
            The Data Protection Policy will, under normal circumstances, be managed and reviewed annually. The reviews to the Policy will be
            subject to scrutiny and, from time to time, updates and re-issues will be circulated.
            <br /> <br />
            However, the Policy will be reviewed sooner in the event of any one or more of the following:

            To avoid inappropriate usage, we have introduced security electronic safeguards. A firewall checks, guarantees and manages
            e-mail attachments. The Organisation has installed filtering software that searches e-mails for specific words or phrases,
            normally obscene or discriminatory, and monitors which websites our employees are accessing as well as filtering which types of
            websites our employees can access.
